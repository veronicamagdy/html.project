Some of the most common forms of mobile computing devices are as given below:

<p>
2) Smart cards that can run multiple applications but are typically used for payment, travel, and secure area access.
<p>
3) Mobile phones, telephony devices which can call from a distance through cellular networking technology.
<p>
4) Wearable computers, mostly limited to functional keys and primarily intended as the incorporation of software agents, such as bracelets, key-less implants, etc.
